<h4>Chapter 1: Vacation.....SM?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> is on vacation after a year of suffering in <i>school</i>. <br>
He thinks of places he wanted to go while browsing with his <u>phone</u>. After an hour ofn thinking, he decided to  <br>
go and spend his first day of vacation in <i>Esem (SM)</i> since its cheaper to travel than any other places.  <br>
After a long ride of <u>jeepney</u>, he arrived at <i>SM</i>, he took a deep breath and muttered "I missed this place". <br>
He checks every store; <i>clothing store, tech store, and department store</i>. He didn't buy anything; he just look at the items that <br>
might be worth of buying. After a long walk, he decided to go eat at <i>Jollibee</i>. On his way there, he saw his classmante <b style="color: red">Juana</b> <br>
sitting on a bench crying.
</p>

<h4>Chapter 2: Jollibee but not Jolly?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> approaced <b style="color: red;">Juana</b>, once he called <b style="color: red;">Juana's</b> name <br>
she looks at him with tears in her eyes. They sat <i>on that bench</i>, <b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> already forgot that he is hungry, started to listen to <b style="color: red">Juana</b> ranting about her day. <br>
She starts ranting about a guy she met in the <i>school's library</i>, they talked and developed feelings. <b style="color: red;">Juana</b> took a deep breath before continuing. <br>
One week before vacation... she asked the dude to go out with her but at the last minute he cancels it and go with someone else. To <b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b>, she is just overreacting, she stopped <b style="color: red;">Juana</b> <br>
from ranting and invited her to go with him at <i>Jollibee</i>. Once they're in there, she keeps ranting about the guy, and started crying loud again once they are eating. In <b style="color: blue;">Ivan's</b> mind, he thinks that she took <br>
the jolly in <i>Jollibee</i>.

</p>


<h4>Chapter 3: I somehow made her day?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After eating, <b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> and <b style="color: red;">Juana</b>, sat <i>in front of an arcade</i>. She is calm now and not ranting anything anymore. <br>
<b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b>, grabbed <b style="color: red;">Juana's</b> hand and went to the <i>arcade</i>. They played a lot of games like <u>Whack a Mole</u>, <u>Tekken</u>, and <u>The Claw Machine</u>. After that, <b style="color: red;">Juana</b> asked <b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> <br>
why did you treat me to that arcade. He just replies, "I just want to cheer you up, that's what friends do right?" <br>
<b style="color: red;">Juana</b> smiled then they proceeded doing a lot of fun things. They ended their day with a small picture inside a photobooth. <br>
<b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> keeps complaining that they don't need it, but <b style="color: red;">Juana</b> insisted that they should took one.
After that on his way home <b style="color: blue;">Ivan</b> received a message from <b style="color: red;">Juana</b> thanking him for making her day fun and asking if when they could hangout again.
<b style="color: blue;"> Ivan</b> smiled and muttered, "I'm glad I went to Esem."
